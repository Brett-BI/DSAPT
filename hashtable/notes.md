# Hash Tables
## Overview
Generally speaking, a hash table is a data structure comprised of indexed set of key:value pairs. Each key in the hash table corresponds to a value. This is, essentially, a dictionary in Python. 

## Issues & Limitations
Duplicates cause errors: one key cannot point to multiple values.
